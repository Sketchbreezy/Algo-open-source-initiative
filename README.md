# 🤝 The Algo Open Source Initiative

> A community effort to support transparency, collaboration and shared ownership in the Algorand ecosystem.

---

## Overview

This repo is a space for community members and builders to share thoughts and resources on why open-sourcing Algorand’s core code could be a positive step forward.

We believe it would:

- Help more developers feel confident building on Algorand
- Encourage new tools, integrations and contributions
- Strengthen the sense of community ownership around the protocol

This is not about complaints, it’s about possibility, and keeping Algorand open to innovation from everywhere.

---

## Why This Matters

Keeping the core closed creates limitations for contributors and slows down ecosystem growth.  
If Algorand is going to thrive long-term, more people should be able to explore, learn from and build on its foundation.
